        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, together with my fellow group members, I created a
          branding for Woody&Truus to promote their pub crawl to get more
          listeners to the brown cafes. They want to bring new life to Dutch
          folk singing with their new version of Smartlappen called
          Neo-Smartlappen.

        <h2>Research</h2>

        <h3>What did I do?</h3>
        <p>
          In the beginning I started off with finding out what kind of color
          scheme was used in bruin cafes. With these colors and letter types I
          made the first Stylescape together with Lila.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stylescapes were based of some interviews that I did at the local
          bruincafes to gather some more information about Smartlappen. see the
          interviews

            target="_blank"
            >here.</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          After getting feedback from Woody, We discovered that this stylescape
          wasn't what Woody had in mind for his pubcrawl and he wanted a
          different stylescape. The stylescape that we chose to work with wasn't
          made by me. To view the stylescapes and other research that I did

        <h2>Brand guide</h2>
        <p>
          In the Brand Guide I made some logo's. These logo's weren't going to
          be the final logo's that were going to be used by our group but
          iterations of them. More information about our teamwork on the brand
          guide and my work specifically click

        <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          I worked on making a goal for the content strategy. The goal would be:
          To create a fun and engaging pub crawl event that brings people
          together, promotes Woody&Truus' unique music style, and builds a
          vibrant community around their neo-smartlappen sound. For more about
          the content strategy click

        </p>
        <h2>Final Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          In the final presentation I and my groupmates combined everything and
          presented our work to Woody and Truus themselves. To view the
          presentation click

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoyed working for a real client. I learned a lot about what it's
          like to work for a client and what to expect. This also gave me new
          insights into how a brand is built and how to make a brand guide for a
          client. I also found it challenging to create things without any
          guidelines on how it should look or what style the client wants, since
          this wasn't defined yet. This added a new level of difficulty. I
          didn't find it very comfortable to work this way because I'm not very
          skilled at design, but I did make progress in researching and learning
          how to communicate certain things to the client.
