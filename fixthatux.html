        <h2>Fix that UX</h2>
        <p>
          I worked on a project from Hike One where I had to pick one of three
          health insurance companies to improve their premium calculator design.
          Throughout the project, I explained why I made certain choices between
          the three options and why I didn't choose others. I also teamed up
          with Sara to code the premium calculator that my group and I designed.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          I started by researching the three companies that needed a redesign:
          CZ.nl, Zekur.nl, and Zilverenkruis.nl. Our team split up into smaller
          groups, with each group focusing on one website. I was assigned to
          look into Zekur.nl. My task was to identify any design issues on the
          site and figure out what changes were needed to improve it.
          <br />
          <br />
          I began by reviewing the website on my own, noting my first
          impressions of the entire process and identifying both its positives
          and negatives. To view my first impressions click
          <a href="docs/FixThatUX/firstimpression.pdf">
            <span class="here-link">here. </span></a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          To complete my research on Zekur.nl, I ran some user tests on its
          design. I did two tests: one person tested the desktop version, and
          another tested the mobile version. The desktop tester also had mild
          colorblindness, which gave me some extra insights. The test results
          were pretty negative but not the worst. The main issue was the lack of
          error prevention or any warnings when filling out information
          incorrectly. To view the whole usertest click
          <a href="docs/FixThatUX/usertesting.pdf">
            <span class="here-link">here. </span></a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          In conclusion, I created a summary of all the main points about
          Zekur.nl to get a clearer overview. I also explained why our group
          decided not to go with Zekur.nl and chose to continue with CZ.nl for
          our project. To see the summary and the reasons behind our choice of
          CZ.nl over Zekur.nl, click
          <a href="docs/FixThatUX/summarychoice.pdf">
            <span class="here-link">here. </span></a
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          To make the design as effective as possible, I created some research
          questions to guide the process. These questions served as a checklist
          for what the website should include for optimal design. To see the
          research questions, click
          <a href="docs/FixThatUX/researchplan.pdf">
            <span class="here-link">here. </span></a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          To begin the redesign of CZ.nl, my group and I divided the website
          into sections to speed up the process. I worked on the "Fill in Your
          Details" page. To make it easier for everyone to contribute, we
          created both an English and a Dutch version of the design. I was
          mainly responsible for translating much of the website into Dutch and
          to make part of the prototype. To view the pages that I made click
          <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/proto/9HZNQYy32GSkLoIudr4t91/sem-2---fix-ux-(Copy)?page-id=2351%3A395&node-id=2351-1092&p=f&viewport=536%2C369%2C0.14&t=o4CL5OcYOrezf9bO-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed"

          whole prototype.

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>
          Together with Sara I started to code the prototype. We devided the
          website in different parts. Components and normal pages.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unfortunately, early on in the project, I parted ways with Sara and
          continued the coding on my own. I focused on implementing the design
          we had created and ensuring that the user experience was smooth and
          intuitive. The only parts that Sara made were the navigation bar and
          the footer.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project was truly different to create and felt like a big step up
          from the previous projects I worked on this semester. I got to
          experience what it's like to work as part of a design company and
          learned about the steps needed to create a good product for a client.
          One key takeaway was realizing that before you can redesign a website,
          there's an entire process to go through, including building solid
          reasons for each change. The coding part was the most enjoyable for
          me, as I hope to pursue web development in the future this part was
          exactly in line with my interests.
