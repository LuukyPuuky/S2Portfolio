        <h2>Personal Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          For this learning outcome, I'm aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I
          reflect on my actions and work to improve from my mistakes. On this
          page, I'll show how I've developed my personal leadership skills and
          how I can improve them in the future.

        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <p>
          I tried to explore different directions on what I wanted to be in the
          future and put some steps in to achieve that. I first started to learn
          Astro.
          <br />
          I decided to challenge myself by using this framework as part of my
          journey toward becoming a front-end developer. I took the first steps
          to build my portfolio with the framework, but soon realized it was too
          difficult to understand and work with. As a result, I fell behind in
          the process. Eventually, I made the decision to discard the idea of
          using the Astro framework and started over with a different approach.
          This experience taught me the importance of choosing the right tools
          for my current skill level and goals, and I'll be more mindful of this
          in future projects.

        <h2>Example 3</h2>
        <p>
          For this example I went to Career day organised by Fontys to look into
          what kind of internships I want to do in the later semesters. I also
          looked into what I would learn in Semesters 6 and 7. These semesters
          are called Advanced Media. It was important for me to know what I
          would learn in those semesters so I could prepare for them in the
          future.
          <br />
          I also explored Open Learning because I want to have the freedom to
          choose what I want to study. What I really appreciate about this
          approach is the ability to work on topics that interest me and shape
          my own path, rather than following a rigid, one-size-fits-all
          curriculum.

          For this final example, I stepped out into the field to interview
          locals at bruincaf√©s in Eindhoven as part of the Branding project. I
          visited five different bars, but unfortunately, only two people were
          willing to participate in the research. Despite the limited number of
          interviews, their input provided valuable insights for the project.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Because of the Career Day I have a better understanding of what I want
          to study in the future and what I want to persue to become a better
          developer. I also think that I should focus more on asking for
          feedback since I don't ask a lot for that and that it's a personal
          goal of mine to let teachers and other people see my work so I can
          iterate on it.
