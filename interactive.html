        <h2>Interactive Media Design</h2>
        <p>
          For this learning outcome, I created interactive media products that I
          tested with users and stakeholders. I got multiple different products
          that are listed below.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="example1" class="section">
        <h2>A-B Test</h2>
        <h4>Project FixThatUX</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this first example I did an A-B test about the basket within the
          premium calculator for the CZ website that I had to redesign and code
          with the Hike One, Fix That UX project. First slide is A, second one
          is B.

        <h3>Why did I do the usertest?</h3>
        <p>
          I carried out the user test to gather feedback and improve the design
          of my prototype. To make the process more structured, I created a form
          that users could fill out, which helped me get a clear overview of
          their preferences and decisions. My primary goal was to understand
          what users liked most about each design and identify areas for
          improvement. In conclusion, the feedback revealed that users preferred
          Slide A due to its clarity, fast overview, and simplicity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After the full presentation of the project, it was pointed out that I
          missed an opportunity to test with professionals. Since I only tested
          with my friends from my study association, I missed out on gaining
          feedback from my teachers, which could have provided valuable
          insights.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="example2" class="section">
        <h2>Figma Prototype</h2>
        <h4>Project FixThatUX</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this example, I created an interactive prototype using Figma. The
          prototype is a redesign of the CZ website, which I created as part of
          the Hike One, Fix That UX project.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why did I create this prototype?</h3>
        <p>
          I created this prototype as an introduction to demonstrate what the
          real website would look and feel like, providing the client with a
          beginner-level overview. The goal was to present the project in a way
          that allowed our client to see and understand what my groupmates and I
          had created.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          More details about this project, along with the full Figma file, can
          be found in my Hike One, Fix That UX project documentation
          <a class="here-link" href="fixthatux.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="example3" class="section">
        <h2>Code Product</h2>
        <h4>Project FixThatUX</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this example, I developed a fully interactive version of the Figma
          Prototype as a coded website. I first designed the prototype in Figma
          and then implemented it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To view the
          full website, go to
          <a
            class="here-link"
            href="https://fixthatux.luuksteijaert.nl/"
            target="_blank"
            >fixthatux.luuksteijaert.nl</a
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why did I put the project live on the internet?</h3>
        <p>
          I published the project online both as a learning experience and to
          make it permanent. Having it accessible on the internet allows
          everyone to view it and also helps me track my own coding progress
          more easily.
        </p>

      <div id="example4" class="section">
        <h2>Interview</h2>
        <h4>Project Branding</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this example, I did an interview with bruincafe locals to gather
          more information about the music taste, a colorscheme that they liked
          within the bruincafes and much more questions. I used this information
          so that me and my groupmates had a better understanding what we needed
          our stylescape should look like.
        </p>
        <div class="images">
          <img src="assets/interviewbruincafe.jpg" alt="interview" />
        </div>
        <p>
          This was the inside of the bruincafe where I did the interview. It
          already gave me a good idea of what the colorscheme should look like.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          to view the whole interview, click
          <a
            class="here-link"
            href="docs/Branding/Interviews.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >here.</a
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Why did I do the interview?</h3>
        <p>
          I did the interview because I wanted to know what it looks like within
          a bruincafe. What music is played, if it's busy or not, and what kind
          of people go to the bruincafe. This information was important for the
          making of the stylescape.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting on this process, I found it quite challenging to get
          started on creating this page. Looking back, I feel that I could have
          created better prototypes, conducted more thorough user research, and
          performed a more comprehensive user test on my portfolio. I believe
          these aspects were areas where I fell short. Additionally, I wasn't
          fully satisfied with the design choices I made for the first part of
          my website. I struggled a lot with the design aspect, as I don't
          consider myself a strong designer and tend to gravitate more toward
          the coding side of projects.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h3>What do I want to do in the Future?</h3>
        <p>
          In the future I plan to improve my Figma skills and ask for more
          feedback on my designs. I also plan to do more user tests and think
          more about the necessity of conducting user tests.
