        <h2>Development and Version Control</h2>
        <p>
          For this learning outcome, I explored front-end development languages, wrote code and documented it in a version control environment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          During this semester I learned a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also made use of Git and made sure the code is clear and accessible. Providing clarity to others and my future self. For every project, I also made a README file where I explain details about the project and how to use it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="example1" class="section">
        <h2 >Example 1</h2>
        <p>
          For the first example, I created a README file for my portfolio website. The README explains the purpose of the project, provides installation instructions, and guides users on how to use it. It is written in Markdown and can be found in the repository of my portfolio website on GitHub.
        
          to view the readme file on GitHub, click 
          <a
            class="here-link"
            href="https://github.com/LuukyPuuky/S2Portfolio/blob/main/README.md"

        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <p>
        For this example, I used Git to track my progress and have version control because it provides a reliable way to manage and organize my project. With Git, I can easily save and review different versions of my work, which helps prevent losing progress if something goes wrong. It also enables me to experiment with new ideas in separate branches, allowing me to make changes without affecting the main project. Additionally, using Git enhances collaboration, as I can easily share my code with others and merge their contributions seamlessly. Overall, Git ensures that I can keep my work organized, secure, and easily manageable throughout the development process.        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why did I use Github?</h3>
        <p>
          The prefered Git environment for me is GitHub. School uses Gitlab but I prefer GitHub because it is more user-friendly and has a better interface. I also like the fact that GitHub has a lot of integrations with other tools and services, which makes it easier to automate workflows and collaborate with others. 
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Here is a link to my GitHub profile: 
          <a
            class="here-link"
            href="https://github.com/LuukyPuuky"
            target="_blank"
            >github.com/LuukyPuuky</a>
          
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="example3" class="section">
        <h2>Example 3</h2>
        <p>
          For this example, I developed a fully interactive version of Example 2
          as a coded website. I first designed the prototype in Figma and then
          implemented it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To view the full
          website, go to
          <a
            class="here-link"
            href="https://fixthatux.luuksteijaert.nl/"
            target="_blank"
            >fixthatux.luuksteijaert.nl</a
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why did I put the project live on the internet?</h3>
        <p>
          I published the project online both as a learning experience and to
          make it permanent. Having it accessible on the internet allows
          everyone to view it and also helps me track my own coding progress
          more easily.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting on this process, I found it quite challenging to get
          started on creating this page. Looking back, I feel that I could have
          created better prototypes, conducted more thorough user research, and
          performed a more comprehensive user test on my portfolio. I believe
          these aspects were areas where I fell short. Additionally, I wasn't
          fully satisfied with the design choices I made for the first part of
          my website. I struggled a lot with the design aspect, as I don't
          consider myself a strong designer and tend to gravitate more toward
          the coding side of projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>What do I want to do in the Future?</h3>
          <p>In the future I plan to improve my Figma skills and ask for more
            feedback on my designs. I also plan to do more user tests and think
            more about the necessity of conducting user tests.</p>
