        <h2>Portfolio Progress</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I took time to explore my interests and consider how
          to showcase them in my portfolio. I made several design choices, and
          I'll explain why I pursued certain directions and decided against
          others. I'll also reflect on the reasoning behind my choices and how I
          approached each decision.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          To kick off my portfolio, I started by researching a variety of
          portfolio styles. I already had an idea of what I liked: a
          minimalistic, dark-mode theme. I chose a minimalistic approach because
          I wanted the website to look clean and professional. Dark mode was
          also a priority, as it's popular among developers and many users
          online.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also wanted to explore using gradients. Gradients have been a big
          trend this year and are expected to stay popular for years to come.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/gradientresearch.png" alt="gradientresearch" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          After researching gradients, I wanted my portfolio to reflect my
          personality. Initially, I was inspired by a Spotify-themed website
          created by one of my groupmates last year and decided to design my
          site with a Pokémon theme. However, after receiving feedback, I
          decided to switch to a more minimalistic structure and ultimately
          discarded the Pokémon theme entirely.
        </p>

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          I started off with wireframing my ideas that I had. These three
          wireframes were the original idea.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          I asked for feedback on the wireframe and the answer that I got is
          that I displayed way to much information for what was currently needed
          for my portfolio.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As Joris said and I quote: "You don't need to add your skills on your
          website because us as teachers are not interested in that
          information".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I started to implement what I researched for in my portfolio. Using
          the darkmode theme and the different cards in the design. I also
          incorporated gradients to add a modern touch in the texts and the
          different pages. Below is an example of the final wireframe that i
          worked on.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          I began exploring different colors from a website that caught my
          attention and focused on these three colors:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div>
          <img class="colors" src="assets/colors.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          I liked these colors because they work well together as a gradient and
          also stand out individually on a darker background.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I went for a minimalistic design based of my friend's design, Pepijn
          Latour. I asked him if i could use his design as inspiration for my
          design and he was okay with that.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/pepijn.png" alt="pepijn" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          For the main page, I wanted to incorporate bouldering holds into the
          design. Bouldering is a sport I'm passionate about, and I often climb
          at Monk in Eindhoven. I decided to include this as a subtle,
          minimalistic design element on both the main page and the About Me
          page to reflect something personal about myself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/mainpage.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/otherpages.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          After getting some feedback on my designs I changed up the designs and
          you can watch them currently on what the website looks like now.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project was hard to make because I had to identify myself in a
          website. Adding different things to the website that made me, me. I
          liked to work on the project but it was hard for me to pick the right
          designs because I'm not so good in the designing part but I love the
          coding bit of it.
