        <h2>Portfolio Progress</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I took time to explore my interests and consider how
          to showcase them in my portfolio. I made several design choices, and
          I'll explain why I pursued certain directions and decided against
          others. I'll also reflect on the reasoning behind my choices and how I
          approached each decision.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          To kick off my portfolio, I started by researching a variety of
          portfolio styles. I already had an idea of what I liked: a
          minimalistic, dark-mode theme. I chose a minimalistic approach because
          I wanted the website to look clean and professional. Dark mode was
          also a priority, as it's popular among developers and many users
          online.

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also wanted to explore using gradients. Gradients have been a big
          trend this year and are expected to stay popular for years to come.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/gradientresearch.png" alt="gradientresearch" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          After researching gradients, I wanted my portfolio to reflect my
          personality. Initially, I was inspired by a Spotify-themed website
          created by one of my groupmates last year and decided to design my
          site with a Pokémon theme. However, after receiving feedback, I
          decided to switch to a more minimalistic structure and ultimately
          discarded the Pokémon theme entirely.

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          I started off with wireframing my ideas that I had. These three
          wireframes were the original idea.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="big-image">
          <img src="assets/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          I asked for feedback on the wireframe and the answer that I got is
          that I displayed way to much information for what was currently needed
          for my portfolio.

          As Joris said and I quote: "You don't need to add your skills on your
          website because us as teachers are not interested in that
          information".

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project was truly different to create and felt like a big step up
          from the previous projects I worked on this semester. I got to
          experience what it's like to work as part of a design company and
          learned about the steps needed to create a good product for a client.
          One key takeaway was realizing that before you can redesign a website,
          there's an entire process to go through, including building solid
          reasons for each change. The coding part was the most enjoyable for
          me, as I hope to pursue web development in the future this part was
          exactly in line with my interests.
