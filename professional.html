        <h2>Professional Standard</h2>
        <p>
          For this learning outcome I show my personal standards individually
          and in teams. I involve with stakeholders, communication, research and
          reporting.

        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <p>In this example I used Trello to communicate with my groupmates.</p>
        <h3>Why did I do the project communication like this?</h3>
        <p>
          I used Trello to keep track of the progress of the project and to
          comm+unicate with my groupmates. In the beginning of the semester I
          made a trelloboard for the fast forward project and made a good
          planning on what to do each day. We discussed who did which part of
          the project and filled each task with the person doing that.

        <p>
          The feedback that I got was that I had too many elements that didn't
          really fit in the portfolio that I needed to make for this portfolio.
          I then simplified the design and made it more minimalistic with less
          elements.

        <p>
          As part of the design process, I explored multiple themes, drawing
          inspiration from things I'm passionate about, including Pokémon.
          Initially, I was excited to incorporate this into the final design,
          but after much experimentation, I realized that the design wasn't
          quite meeting my expectations.
          <br />
          Through careful consideration, I decided to move away from the Pokémon
          theme and opted for a simpler, more streamlined design. This decision
          reflects the iterative nature of the designer's process: trying out
          bold ideas, assessing their impact, and ultimately choosing the path
          that best serves the overall vision and goals of the project.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This journey helped me refine not only the design itself but also my
          approach to creativity and problem-solving.

      <div id="example2" class="section">
        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <p>
          For this example, I created a stylescape for the brandguide of Woody
          Truus. I created a stylescape and so did my groupmates. My stylescape
          wasn't the one that we eventually chose to iterate but it was part of
          the whole process.
          <br />
          My first stylescape was inspired by the traditional “bruincafés” in
          Eindhoven.

        <p>
          After receiving feedback from my teacher, I created a second version
          of the design, incorporating a new look and addressing the key points
          from the critique. One major takeaway was to avoid using Lorem Ipsum,
          as it doesn't contribute meaningfully to the design. Additionally, I
          learned to shift the focus away from irrelevant elements or people,
          ensuring that the design highlights what truly matters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My design wasn't chosen to iterate further on but I learned a lot from
          the feedback that I got from my teacher and my groupmates. to see the

      <div id="example3" class="section">
        <h2>Example 3</h2>
        <p>
          For this example, I created some logo's for the brandguide of the
          client. I made the first two logo's using Canva and input from the
          client.
        </p>

        <div class="logo-images">

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          After presenting these logo designs to the client and the rest of the
          group, I received valuable feedback that guided the next steps. The
          client particularly liked a design created by one of my groupmates,
          which featured skull elements. Taking this into account, I made slight
          adjustments to my logo design and incorporated skulls, with the help
          of AI, to align with the client's preferences.

      <div id="example4" class="section">
        <h2>Example 4</h2>
        <p>
          For this example, I created an iteration based on the results of an
          A/B test conducted during the "basket case" phase of the Hike One
          project. The insights from the test provided data-driven direction,
          allowing me to refine the design to better meet user needs and project
          goals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I wasn't entirely satisfied with the original design, so I created my
          own version as an alternative. To ensure the best fit for the project,
          I involved the users by letting them decide which version resonated
          most with the design goals. The users decided to use my design, which
          was design A.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Through these examples, I learned the importance of iteration in the
          design process. By creating multiple versions of a design and
          incorporating feedback from stakeholders and users, I was able to
          refine my work and create more effective solutions. This iterative
          approach allowed me to explore different ideas, test their impact, and
          make informed decisions based on the results.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What do I want to do in the Future?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the future I want to have more iterations on my designs. At the
          current moment I think I didn't do a lot of iterations of different
          designs and I should have done more. I also want to get more feedback
          on those iterations.
