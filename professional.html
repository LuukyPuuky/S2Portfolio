        <h2>Professional Standard</h2>
        <p>
          For this learning outcome I show my personal standards individually
          and in teams. I involve with stakeholders, communication, research and
          reporting.

        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <p>In this example I used Trello to communicate with my groupmates.</p>
        <h3>Why did I do the project communication like this?</h3>
        <p>
          I used Trello to keep track of the progress of the project and to
          communicate with my groupmates. In the beginning of the semester I
          made a trelloboard for the fast forward project and made a good
          planning on what to do each day. We discussed who did which part of
          the project and filled each task with the person doing that.

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also used the Trello board for my Branding project. Lila set up the
          board, and I edited the tables to create a clear overview of our
          tasks. This included organizing what needed to be done, what was in
          progress, what required feedback, and what was finished.

        <br />
        <h3>Why did I use trello?</h3>
        <p>
          For these projects, I chose to use Trello because of its intuitive UI
          and its ability to focus on the essentials, making it an excellent
          tool for smaller-scale projects. While I also enjoy using Jira, Me and
          my team decided in a vote to use Trello because it was easier to use
          and we didn't need all the features that Jira has.

        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <p>
          In this example, I made some parts of the mid-term demo presentation
          for the Fix That UX project and I also made some parts of the final
          presentation of that project. I also did most of the talking in those
          presentations.

        <h2>Example 3</h2>
        <p>
          For this final example, I created the document for the Fast Forward
          Project so that my entire group could collaborate in one centralized
          Word document. This ensured that all the content was well-organized
          and easily accessible, providing a clear overview for everyone
          involved.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Through these examples, I realized that I fell short in maintaining
          consistent communication with the client and stakeholders. Looking
          back, I see that I should have made more effort to engage with them
          throughout the projects. Unfortunately, I don't have concrete examples
          or written evidence to demonstrate meaningful interactions. My contact
          was limited to brief conversations and small talk after presentations,
          which wasn't enough to build strong connections or document
          significant feedback.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What do I want to do in the Future?</h3>
        <p>
          In the future I want to have better communication with the client so I
          can describe concrete examples of how I communicated with them. I also
          want to have more feedback from the client so I can improve my work.
