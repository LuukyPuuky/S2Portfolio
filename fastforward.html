        <h2>Fast Forward</h2>
        <p>
          For Fontys Media Design's Fast Forward Week, we created
          <span class="here-link" style="color: var(--secondarycolor)"
            >Neuro</span
          >
          <span style="color: var(--tertiarycolor)">Vision </span>. The
          challenge was to design something we believe could realistically exist
          in 2050. Right from the start, we saw that education would be very
          different in the future since it's already changing so much today. We
          liked this idea, so we chose to focus on the education category.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          First we started off to get as many ideas to what will happen to
          education in the future. I started doing research on current views of
          what the future would look like in education. We started into looking
          for using AI and VR , but later changed that through iterations to AI
          and XR. (extended reality). Our idea that we have is that in the
          future, education will be done through these glasses and you can get
          immerged into the classroom. For example with an history lesson you
          can be there at that exact moment and experience it but not alter it.

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
          To visualize and to represent our concept we made an what if
          statement: What if, by 2050 extended reality will be used in everyday
          life. We made some sketches on what the glasses would look like.

        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          Using the concept ideas we made a final prototype and presentation to
          present our idea to the other groups. The final prototype was an mp4
          video of what it would look like when you used the glasses in a
          setting to learn French. To watch the video click

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I was pretty new to doing a group project in English. I didn't work
          like that before so that was a small challenge on itself. I think
          during the project I didn't really know what to do all too well but I
          am very happy with the final product and how I presented it to the
          other groups during the final presentations. I did most of the talking
          about our product.
