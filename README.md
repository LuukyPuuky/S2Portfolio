## 📂 Projects

Here’s a glimpse of the projects I’ve worked on:

1. **[FastForward](#)**

   - **Description**: Fast forward is a project that I worked on in the introduction week of Semester 2 Media & Design. It's about making a product that you thought would be realistic in 2050.

2. **[Branding](#)**

   - **Description**: The Branding project was the first real project for a client. Together with my group we worked on a brand guide for Woody & Truus. They wanted to organize a pubcrawl and they needed to have a brand for that.

3. **[Fix That UX](#)**

   - **Description**: The Fix that UX project has two sides, one side is the part where I together with my group worked on researching different health insurance companies. We also had to redesign a chozen company, (for us that was CZ). The other side was the coding part and I mostly did that part alone because my groupmate left me.

4. **[Portfolio](#)**
   - **Description**: The portfolio project is the portfolio you are about to review and is within this github repository.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

For this project I need to accomplish some learning outcomes:

- **Interactive Media Products**: You orient in the relevant tech, media and design landscape and create interactive media products that you have tested with users and stakeholders.
- **Development and Version control**: You explore front-end development languages, you write code and document in a version control environment.
- **Iterative design**: You explore and use professional design tools and you iteratively design visual works.
- **Professional standard**: You apply professional practice, both individually and in teams, in the areas of project organisation, communication with stakeholders, exploratory research, and reporting.
- **Personal Leadership**: You take the initiative in asking for, and reflecting on, feedback. You identify your own core values as the basis for your study career and professional development.
