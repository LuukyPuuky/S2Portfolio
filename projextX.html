        <h2>Project X</h2>

        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Before starting this project I had to hand in a planning and a project
          proposal. I made a planning for my project.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why did I make a planning?</h3>
        <p>
          I made a planning to know what I had to do and when I had to do it.
          This way I could easily track my progress and see if I was done in
          time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How did I do it?</h3>
        <p>
          I checked how much time we had for the project and what tasks I needed
          to complete. Then, I created a plan based on the available time.
        </p>

            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >
          for the the planning in full size.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to rewrite the CSS of the website
          <a
            class="here-link"
            href="https://atomizedesign.com/?aff=g5dePe"
            target="_blank"
            >Atomize Design</a
          >
          The focus is on implementing either Tailwind CSS or SCSS with the BEM
          (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology. This project will not involve
          redesigning the website in Figma but instead focuses solely on the
          technical implementation of CSS using the specified tools.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to address some learning outcomes to this project to have
          extra evidence for them. The learning outcomes I wanted to address
          are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Development &amp; Git</li>
          <li>Interactive Media Design</li>
          <li>Iterative Design</li>
          <li>Professional standard</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h2>Content &amp; Research</h2>
        <p>
          The original plan was to start working on Project X the week before
          the Christmas break and finish it in the first week of the new year.
          Unfortunately, I fell a bit behind on my portfolio, so I postponed the
          planning and began focusing on Project X after the break.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What is Tailwind?</h3>
        <p>
          Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building
          custom designs. It is a CSS framework that gives you all of the
          building blocks you need to build a website. It is a utility-first
          framework, which means that it provides low-level utility classes that
          let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML
          file.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How did I learn Tailwind?</h3>
        <p>
          I focussed on watching tutorials about Tailwind CSS. I first had to
          discover and learn how to setup a repository with Tailwind installed
          and having all the correct configurations for that. I watched a
          youtube video to do this.
          <br />
          I also used the official Tailwind documentation to search up different
          css classes that were changed in Tailwind. For example writing
          "bg-red-500" in tailwind is the same as writing "background-color:
          red" in css.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Realisation</h3>
        <p>
          After the first week, I realized that learning Tailwind and building
          the entire website would take much longer than I had initially
          planned. So, I messaged Stan on Teams to let him know that I wanted to
          focus solely on Tailwind and not experiment with other methods for the
          website.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="images">
          <img src="assets/changeProjectX.png" alt="change project X" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Stan was okay with this proposal and I began to focus purely on making
          the tailwind version of the website.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          I started the development of the website by creating a new repository
          on Github. I then installed Tailwind CSS. I also installed the
          Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension in Visual Studio Code to help me
          with writing the classes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I made multiple commits to the repository to keep track of my
          progress. See the repository

        </div>
        <br />
        <h3>Website Division</h3>
        <p>
          I divided the website into multiple sections. I created a header,
          footer and multiple different sections so I could easily navigate and
          have a clear overview of the website.
